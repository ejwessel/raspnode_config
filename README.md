# Raspnode Config

### Why/Motivation
I wanted to setup a raspberypi as a Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum full node, but most of the resources I found online were no longer maintained, hard to find, or had fragmented steps. For example, when I started I was following the guides at http://raspnode.com/. The steps there awere invaluable for my initial steps, but unfortunately, "it is currently no longer being maintained but will remain online in case people find the tutorials useful." While I was able to find the resources I needed after a while I thought that there might be other people out there that might want to support the network, yet have difficulty getting started or give up due to fragmented resources. Being a developer I decided that I'd try and consolidate the common steps and turn these steps into code; everything can be [infrastrucgure into code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_Code)

I was looking on reddit and using http://raspnode.com/. I wanted a single space where I could repdoduce to multiple different types of nodes if I wanted
